## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `folio-routing` — Creates file-based routes with Laravel Folio. Activates when creating new pages, setting up routes, working with route parameters or model binding, adding middleware to pages, working with resources/views/pages; or when the user mentions Folio, pages, file-based routing, page routes, or creating a new page for a URL path.
- `configuring-horizon` — Use this skill whenever the user mentions Horizon by name in a Laravel context. Covers the full Horizon lifecycle: installing Horizon (horizon:install, Sail setup), configuring config/horizon.php (supervisor blocks, queue assignments, balancing strategies, minProcesses/maxProcesses), fixing the dashboard (authorization via Gate::define viewHorizon, blank metrics, horizon:snapshot scheduling), and troubleshooting production issues (worker crashes, timeout chain ordering, LongWaitDetected notifications, waits config). Also covers job tagging and silencing. Do not use for generic Laravel queues without Horizon, SQS or database drivers, standalone Redis setup, Linux supervisord, Telescope, or job batching.
- `passport-development` — Develops OAuth2 API authentication with Laravel Passport. Activates when installing or configuring Passport; setting up OAuth2 grants (authorization code, client credentials, personal access tokens, device authorization); managing OAuth clients; protecting API routes with token authentication; defining or checking token scopes; configuring SPA cookie authentication; handling token lifetimes and refresh tokens; or when the user mentions Passport, OAuth2, API tokens, bearer tokens, or API authentication. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user works with OAuth2, API tokens, or third-party API access, even if they don't explicitly mention Passport.
- `pulse-development` — Handles Laravel Pulse setup, configuration, and custom card development. Activates when installing Pulse; configuring the dashboard or authorization gate; setting up recorders and filtering; building custom Livewire cards; optimizing with Redis ingest or sampling; or when the user mentions /pulse, pulse:check, pulse:work, Pulse::record(), or application monitoring.
- `socialite-development` — Manages OAuth social authentication with Laravel Socialite. Activate when adding social login providers; configuring OAuth redirect/callback flows; retrieving authenticated user details; customizing scopes or parameters; setting up community providers; testing with Socialite fakes; or when the user mentions social login, OAuth, Socialite, or third-party authentication.
- `wayfinder-development` — Activates whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components. Use when importing from @/actions or @/routes, calling Laravel routes from TypeScript, or working with Wayfinder route functions.
- `fluxui-development` — Use this skill for Flux UI development in Livewire applications only. Trigger when working with <flux:*> components, building or customizing Livewire component UIs, creating forms, modals, tables, or other interactive elements. Covers: flux: components (buttons, inputs, modals, forms, tables, date-pickers, kanban, badges, tooltips, etc.), component composition, Tailwind CSS styling, Heroicons/Lucide icon integration, validation patterns, responsive design, and theming. Do not use for non-Livewire frameworks or non-component styling.
- `livewire-development` — Use for any task or question involving Livewire. Activate if user mentions Livewire, wire: directives, or Livewire-specific concepts like wire:model, wire:click, wire:sort, or islands, invoke this skill. Covers building new components, debugging reactivity issues, real-time form validation, drag-and-drop, loading states, migrating from Livewire 3 to 4, converting component formats (SFC/MFC/class-based), and performance optimization. Do not use for non-Livewire reactive UI (React, Vue, Alpine-only, Inertia.js) or standard Laravel forms without Livewire.
- `volt-development` — Develops single-file Livewire components with Volt. Activates when creating Volt components, converting Livewire to Volt, working with @volt directive, functional or class-based Volt APIs; or when the user mentions Volt, single-file components, functional Livewire, or inline component logic in Blade files.
- `pest-testing` — Use this skill for Pest PHP testing in Laravel projects only. Trigger whenever any test is being written, edited, fixed, or refactored — including fixing tests that broke after a code change, adding assertions, converting PHPUnit to Pest, adding datasets, and TDD workflows. Always activate when the user asks how to write something in Pest, mentions test files or directories (tests/Feature, tests/Unit, tests/Browser), or needs browser testing, smoke testing multiple pages for JS errors, or architecture tests. Covers: it()/expect() syntax, datasets, mocking, browser testing (visit/click/fill), smoke testing, arch(), Livewire component tests, RefreshDatabase, and all Pest 4 features. Do not use for factories, seeders, migrations, controllers, models, or non-test PHP code.
- `inertia-react-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 React client-side applications. Activates when creating React pages, forms, or navigation; using <Link>, <Form>, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions React with Inertia, React pages, React forms, or React navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.
- `filament-db-config` — Creates database-backed settings pages and config pages with filament-db-config or db-config package. Activates when creating settings page, config page, configuration page, or when user mentions db-config, db_config, DbConfig, database settings, dynamic configuration, runtime config, storing settings in database.

Activates when working with QueryBuilder, AllowedFilter, AllowedSort, AllowedInclude, or when the user mentions query parameters, API filtering, sorting, includes, or spatie/laravel-query-builder.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan Commands

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`, `php artisan tinker --execute "..."`).
- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Debugging

- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- To execute PHP code for debugging, run `php artisan tinker --execute "your code here"` directly.
- To read configuration values, read the config files directly or run `php artisan config:show [key]`.
- To inspect routes, run `php artisan route:list` directly.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use strict typing at the head of a `.php` file: `declare(strict_types=1);`.
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== folio/core rules ===

# Laravel Folio

- Laravel Folio is a powerful page-based router that simplifies routing in Laravel applications.
- Routes are generated automatically by creating Blade templates in `resources/views/pages`.
- IMPORTANT: Activate 'folio-routing' when working with Folio, pages, routes, route parameters, model binding, middleware, or `resources/views/pages`.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== octane/core rules ===

# Octane

- Octane boots the application once and reuses it across requests, so singletons persist between requests.
- The Laravel container's `scoped` method may be used as a safe alternative to `singleton`.
- Never inject the container, request, or config repository into a singleton's constructor; use a resolver closure or `bind()` instead:

```php
// Bad
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn (Application $app) => new Service($app['request']));

// Good
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn () => new Service(fn () => request()));
```

- Never append to static properties, as they accumulate in memory across requests.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` merges with current URL, `null` removes params.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== volt/core rules ===

# Livewire Volt

- Single-file Livewire components: PHP logic and Blade templates in one file.
- Always check existing Volt components to determine functional vs class-based style.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Volt documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `volt-development` every time you're working with a Volt or single-file component-related task.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application. Follow the existing conventions for how and where it is implemented.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel that lets you define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. Built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Always inspect required options before running a command, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Actions encapsulate a button with an optional modal form and logic:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data))

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Always authenticate before testing panel functionality. Filament uses Livewire, so use `Livewire::test()` or `livewire()` (available when `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` is in `composer.json`):

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling actions in pages" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->callAction(DeleteAction::class)
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertRedirect();

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling actions in tables" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` do not span all columns by default. Explicitly set column spans when needed.

=== jeffersongoncalves/filament-refresh-sidebar rules ===

## Filament Refresh Sidebar

A lightweight Filament plugin that keeps sidebar navigation in sync by automatically refreshing when database notifications arrive via Laravel Echo, or manually via a dispatched Livewire event.

### Installation

<code-snippet name="Install the plugin" lang="bash">
composer require jeffersongoncalves/filament-refresh-sidebar
</code-snippet>

### Register Plugin

<code-snippet name="Register in PanelProvider" lang="php">
use JeffersonGoncalves\Filament\RefreshSidebar\RefreshSidebarPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            RefreshSidebarPlugin::make(),
        ]);
}
</code-snippet>

### Manual Refresh from Livewire

<code-snippet name="Dispatch refresh-sidebar event" lang="php">
$this->dispatch('refresh-sidebar');
</code-snippet>

### Features

- Automatic sidebar refresh when database notifications arrive via Laravel Echo
- Manual sidebar refresh by dispatching the `refresh-sidebar` Livewire event
- Zero configuration after plugin registration
- Injects a script via `PanelsRenderHook::SCRIPTS_AFTER`

### Best Practices

- Ensure Laravel Echo is configured for automatic notification-based refresh
- Dispatch `refresh-sidebar` after creating, updating, or deleting records that affect navigation badges
- No config files or migrations needed -- works out of the box

=== laravel/fortify rules ===

# Laravel Fortify

- Fortify is a headless authentication backend that provides authentication routes and controllers for Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: Always use the `search-docs` tool for detailed Laravel Fortify patterns and documentation.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `developing-with-fortify` skill when working with Fortify authentication features.
